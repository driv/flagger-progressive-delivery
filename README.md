Since FluxCD pushes updates to the repo you need to fork this repo and modify a few things before getting started.

### Fix users
```
export GIT_USER=<git_username>
export DOCKER_USER=<dockerhub_username>

grep -l -r '/driv/' | xargs -L1 sed -i "s,/driv/,/$GIT_USER/,g"
grep -l -r ' driv/' | xargs -L1 sed -i "s, driv/, $DOCKER_USER/,g"
git add -u
git commit -m "update users"
git push
```

# Cluster
You can use any cluster you have available
```
kind cluster create --name=kind-fluxcd-buildpacks
```

# FluxCD bootstrap
```
kubectl apply -k clusters/my-cluster/flux-system
```
## Automated cluster bootstrap
It requires having and providing flux with admin access to your organization.

https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/github/

## Cluster manual bootstrap

```
flux create secret git flux-system \
    --url=ssh://git@github.com/driv/flagger-progressive-delivery \
    --export > gotk-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f gotk-secret.yaml
```

Use the `identity.pub` public key from the secret as a deployment key with write access for your repo. Do not push the secret to git.

# Kpack secrets
Dockerhub and GitHub access is needed.

Create a token with read/write access. https://hub.docker.com/settings/security

Replace `<username>` with your DockerHub username and `<token>` with your generated token, and apply the secret. Do not push the secret to git.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: registry-credentials
  namespace: kpack-builders
  annotations:
    kpack.io/docker: https://index.docker.io/v1/
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: <username>
  password: <token>
```

For `git-credentials` You can use the private key from `gotk-secret.yaml` or create a new one (it only needs read access).
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: git-credentials
  namespace: kpack-builders
  annotations:
    kpack.io/git: git@github.com
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
stringData:
  ssh-privatekey: |
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    <your private key>
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

# Update the applications.

Both applications have an `Image` which is using the `apps` branch to track changes. FluxCD commits into the main branch and it creates an infinite loop of build and deployments.

Any change on the `apps` branch will trigger a build and a re-deploy.
